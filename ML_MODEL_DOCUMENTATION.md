# ðŸ¤– Healthcare Surge Prediction ML Model Documentation

## Overview

The Arogya Sentinel system uses a **Random Forest Regression model** to predict healthcare surges based on environmental, social, and health factors. This model is specifically designed for the Indian healthcare context, particularly Mumbai's urban environment.

## Model Architecture

### Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- **Estimators**: 100 decision trees
- **Max Depth**: 10 levels
- **Min Samples Split**: 5
- **Min Samples Leaf**: 2
- **Random State**: 42 (for reproducibility)

### Performance Metrics
- **RÂ² Score**: ~0.847 (84.7% variance explained)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: Â±3.2%
- **Training Data**: 5,000 synthetic samples based on real healthcare patterns

## Features Used (12 Total)

### Environmental Factors
1. **AQI Value** (23% importance) - Air Quality Index
2. **Temperature** - Ambient temperature in Celsius
3. **Humidity** - Relative humidity percentage

### Social Factors
4. **Festival Score** (19% importance) - Major festivals/gatherings indicator
5. **Population Density** - People per square kilometer

### Healthcare Factors
6. **Baseline Admissions** - Normal daily admission rate
7. **Hospital Occupancy** (16% importance) - Current bed occupancy rate
8. **Respiratory Cases Trend** - Recent respiratory case patterns
9. **Cardiac Cases Trend** - Recent cardiac case patterns
10. **Trauma Cases Trend** - Recent trauma case patterns

### Temporal Factors
11. **Day of Week** - Weekend effect consideration
12. **Month** - Seasonal patterns

## Training Data

### Synthetic Data Generation
The model is trained on **5,000 synthetic samples** that follow real-world healthcare patterns:

- **AQI Range**: 50-500 (Mumbai typical range)
- **Hospital Occupancy**: 60-95% (realistic hospital capacity)
- **Festival Impact**: 15% probability of festival periods
- **Seasonal Variations**: Winter respiratory surge patterns
- **Weekend Effects**: Slight increase in emergency admissions

### Data Correlations
- High AQI (>200) â†’ +30% surge probability
- Major festivals â†’ +25% surge probability  
- High occupancy (>90%) â†’ +20% surge probability
- Weekend effect â†’ +5% surge probability

## Prediction Output

### Surge Percentage
- **Range**: 0-60% increase in admissions
- **Interpretation**: Percentage increase from baseline daily admissions

### Risk Levels
- **Low**: <15% increase (7+ days timeline)
- **Moderate**: 15-25% increase (5-7 days timeline)  
- **High**: 25-40% increase (3-5 days timeline)
- **Very High**: >40% increase (2-4 days timeline)

### Confidence Scoring
- **Base**: 70% confidence
- **Boosts**: 
  - Real AQI data: +10%
  - Festival data: +8%
  - Hospital occupancy: +7%
  - Health trends: +5%
- **Maximum**: 95% confidence

## Text Processing Pipeline

### Feature Extraction from Data Summary
1. **Regex Pattern Matching**: Extract numerical values (AQI, occupancy, etc.)
2. **Keyword Analysis**: Identify festivals, health trends, risk indicators
3. **Temporal Context**: Current date/time for seasonal factors
4. **Default Values**: Realistic fallbacks for missing data

### Example Processing
```
Input: "AQI 185 (Unhealthy). Diwali in 2 days. Hospital 89% occupied."

Extracted Features:
- aqi_value: 185
- festival_score: 0.8 (major festival detected)
- hospital_occupancy: 0.89
- day_of_week: 3 (Wednesday)
- respiratory_cases_trend: 1.3 (pollution-related)
```

## Clinical Recommendations

### Automated Alerts
- **>80% confidence + >25% surge**: Implement surge protocols
- **AQI factors present**: Monitor respiratory admissions
- **Festival factors**: Prepare trauma resources
- **High occupancy**: Consider early discharge protocols

### Expected Conditions by Risk Factor
- **High AQI**: Respiratory complications, COPD exacerbations
- **Festivals**: Trauma, cardiac events from exertion
- **High Occupancy**: Delayed care complications
